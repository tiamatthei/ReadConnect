The book is filled with C code to illustrate how mathematics is put into a computer, and the last several chapters show how to implement several cryptographic protocols. The most important is a description of P1363, an IEEE draft standard for public key cryptography.    The main purpose of Implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography is to help \"crypto engineers\" implement functioning, state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms in the minimum time. With detailed descriptions of the mathematics, the reader can expand on the code given in the book and develop optimal hardware or software for their own applications.    Implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography assumes the reader has at least a high school background in algebra, but it explains, in stepwise fashion, what has been considered to be a topic only for graduate-level students.

While it's easy to grasp the theory of SOA, implementing well-designed, practical SOA systems can be a difficult challenge. Developers and enterprise architects still face the following issues:        * How to get high-availability with SOA      * How to know a service has failed      * How to create reports when data is scattered within multiple services      * How to increase the loose coupling of your SOA      * How to solve authentication and authorization for service consumers--internal and external      * How to integrate SOA and the UI      * How to avoid common SOA pitfalls      * How to choose technologies that increase the performance of your services    In SOA Patterns, author Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz provides detailed, technology-neutral solutions to these challenges, and many others. This book provides architectural guidance through patterns and anti-patterns. It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic Problem/Solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.    SOA Patterns shows you how to address common SOA concerns, including the areas of performance, availability, scalability, security, management, service interaction, user interface interaction, and service aggregation. The SOA anti-patterns part shows you how to avoid common mistakes and how to refactor broken systems. The book also maps quality attributes to patterns so that you can easily find the patterns relevant to your problems.    WHAT'S INSIDE:        * Details more than 30 patterns for common SOA scenarios in the areas of security, performace, availability, UI integration, service aggregation and service interaction      * Describes more than 20 SOA pitfalls to avoid      * Spotlights the architecural perspective on SOA      * Explains technology mapping from conceptual solution to current technologies      * Provides extensive and practical advice on matching patterns to technologies  ",

Applied well, it enables programmers to successfully deal with complexity in software and add new features to existing apps with greater ease. DI is the key to writing modular software and producing flexible and maintainable code bases.    While well-known among Java developers and other practitioners of object-oriented design, DI is only now gaining momentum in the .NET community. The Unity container released by Microsoft patterns & practices and the new Microsoft Extensibility Framework (MEF) make DI more relevant than ever for .NET developers.    Dependency Injection in .NET is a comprehensive guide than introduces DI and provides an in-depth look at applying DI practices to .NET apps. In it, you will also learn to integrate DI together with such technologies as Windows Communication Foundation, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Presentation Foundation and other core .NET components.    Building on your existing knowledge of C# and the .NET platform, this book will be most beneficial for readers who have already built at least a few software solutions of intermediate complexity. Most examples are in plain C# without use of any particular DI framework. Later, the book introduces several well-known DI frameworks, such as StructureMap, Windsor and Spring.NET.

            "longDescription": "Java 3D Programming steps programmers through the important design and implementation phases of developing a successful Java 3D application. The book provides invaluable guidance on whether to use Java 3D, user interface design, geometry creation, scene manipulation and final optimizations. The book does not attempt to exhaustively cover the API or replicate the official documentation but rather serves as a roadmap to alert programmers of design issues and potential pitfalls.    The author distills 12 months of using the Java 3D API for commercial projects, as well as innumerable discussions on the Java 3D email list into a book that all Java 3D developers will appreciate. Experienced Java 3D developers will applaud an authoritative resource containing the state-of-the-art in techniques and workarounds, while novice Java 3D programmers will gain a fast-track into Java 3D development, avoiding the confusion, frustration and time wasted learning Java 3D techniques and terminology.    Java 3D Programming comes complete with a comprehensive set of programming examples to illustrate the techniques, features, workarounds and bug fixes contained in the main text.    Readers of this book would include students and postgraduate researchers developing visualization applications for academia. Moderately experienced in Java, some experience of 3D graphics, little or no experience of Java 3D is needed. R+D s/w engineers at commercial institutions.

The reader will become acquainted with the world of custom JSP tags--new JSP technology that is beginning to have an enormous impact on the way people are developing JSP.    JSP tags are Java components that can be used from within a JSP file. By representing these components as tags, code authors can open up their JSP development to the everyday content developer as well as improve their code reuse and separation between presentation and business logic.    The book is fully loaded with many real-world tags including tags to perform iterations, access databases, EJBs, email systems and JavaBeans. To make the tag usage even more real, the book also offers two full-scale case studies in which the reader will see how tags can be used in the context of:    e-Commerce applications  WAP applications that work with current cellular phones  This book covers all aspects of JSP Tag development for Scriptlet-free generation of online content. It focuses on reusable component-centric design via JavaBeans and custom tags to separate presentation from implementation.",

If you prefer not to do the writing yourself, then Java Applets and Channels Without Programming is for you. It collects almost 100 applets on a CD with detailed instructions on how to use each applet. In addition, style issues are discussed in detail; not only will you learn how to use each applet, you will learn when and where it is appropriate to use each applet. The book also introduces the new concept of channels and shows how these can be used on your web site as well.    The CD-ROM also contains an exclusive applet configuration utility, a program that allows you to configure the Java applets on the CD-ROM in a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) environment. When using the utility to configure Java applets, you do not need to know any Java programming or even any HTML programming. All you do is change the value of a parameter and click on a button to see the resulting change to the applet. The applet configuration utility is written in Java and runs in your browser, so it runs on any computer platform for which there is a Java-enabled browser.    The CD-ROM also provides example web pages for more than 60 of the included applets, so you can learn how to use the applets in real-world situations.",

C++/CLI in Action is a practical guide that will help you breathe new life into your legacy C++ programs. The book begins with a concise C++/CLI tutorial. It then quickly moves to the key themes of native/managed code interop and mixed-mode programming. You   ll learn to take advantage of GUI frameworks like Windows Forms and WPF while keeping your native C++ business logic.

            "shortDescription": "   Becoming Agile is not another book to be classified in the existing ones handling agile practices, it's one of the rare writings which will go with you in the adoption and setup/migration to an agile process...This real must-have agilist's bedside book reads very well and will accompany you in your migration agile practices...       Eric Siber, Developpez.com",
            "longDescription": "Agile principles have been a breath of fresh air to many development teams stuck in the middle of a rigid, process-driven environment. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn't a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment. The process will minimize risk as you transition to Agile iteratively, allowing time for your culture and processes to acclimate to Agile principles.",

            "longDescription": "Modern distributed architectures require a secure, reliable way to exchange messages in asynchronous, loosely-coupled systems. For Java developers, the Java Message Service (JMS) provides that core functionality. The Apache ActiveMQ message broker is a complete open source implementation of the JMS specification. The ActiveMQ Message-Oriented Middleware, coupled with its Enterprise Integration Provider are the building blocks of an Enterprise Service Bus   the backbone of a contemporary Service Oriented Architecture.    ActiveMQ is implemented in Java, but it supports client applications written in many other programming languages including C/C++, .NET, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Python, and more. It can be integrated with other open source frameworks including Tomcat, ServiceMix, JBoss, and can easily bridge to other JMS providers.    Apache ActiveMQ in Action is a thorough, practical guide to implementing message-oriented systems in Java using ActiveMQ. The book lays out the core of ActiveMQ in clear language, starting with the anatomy of a JMS message and moving quickly through connectors, message persistence, authentication and authorization. With the basics well in hand, you move into interesting examples of ActiveMQ at work, following a running Stock Portfolio application. You'll integrate ActiveMQ with containers like Geronimo and JBoss and learn to tie into popular Java-based technologies like Spring Framework.    Along the way, you'll pick up best practices forged out of the deep experience the authors bring to the book. You'll learn to integrate with non-Java technologies and explore advanced topics like broker topologies and configuration and performance tuning.    Additionally, the book will introduce readers to using Apache Camel with Apache ActiveMQ as a way to easily utilize the Enterprise Integration Patterns.",

Today, most developers acknowledge the benefits of unit testing and rely on the increasingly sophisticated tools now available. The recently released JUnit 4.5 represents the state of the art in unit testing frameworks, and provides significant new features to improve the Java development process.    JUnit in Action, Second Edition is an up-to-date guide to unit testing Java applications (including Java EE applications) using the JUnit framework and its extensions. This book provides techniques for solving real-world problems such as testing AJAX applications, using mocks to achieve testing isolation, in-container testing for Java EE and database applications, and test automation.    Written to help readers exploit JUnit 4.5, the book covers recent innovations such as the new annotations that simplify test writing, improved exception handling, and the new assertion methods. You'll also discover how to use JUnit extensions to test new application styles and frameworks including Ajax, OSGi, and HTML-based presentation layers.    Using a sample-driven approach, various unit testing strategies are covered, such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications, and web applications. Also addressed are testing strategies using freely available open source frameworks and tools, and how to unit test in isolation with Mock Objects. The book will also bring you up to speed on the latest thinking in TDD, BDD, Continuous Integration, and other practices related to unit testing.  ",

            "longDescription": "For enterprise Java developers, Spring Framework provides remarkable improvements in developer productivity, runtime performance, and overall application quality. Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a wide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That's where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \"the Spring way\" by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You're never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don't have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book divides into three main parts. In Part 1, you'll get a rapid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you're new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 provides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you're building. You'll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 provides domain-specific recipes. Here, you'll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE. Prior exposure to Spring Framework is helpful, but not required.",

            "longDescription": "It seems like we're all being asked to multi-task more than ever   and our computers are no exception to this trend. Multiple processors with multiple cores running multiple threads is quickly becoming the norm. C++ developers will have to master the principles, techniques, and new language features supporting concurrency to stay ahead of the curve.    With the new C++ Standard and Technical Report 2 (TR2), multi-threading is coming to C++ in a big way. There is a new memory model with support for multiple threads, along with a new multi-threading support library featuring low-level atomic operations, as well as basic thread launching and synchronization facilities. TR2 will provide higher-level synchronization facilities that allow for a much greater level of abstraction, and make programming multi-threaded applications simpler and safer.    C++ Concurrency in Action is the first book to show you how to take advantage of the new C++ Standard and TR2 to write robust multi-threaded applications in C++.    As a guide and reference to the new concurrency features in the upcoming C++ Standard and TR, this book is invaluable for existing programmers familiar with writing multi-threaded code in C++ using platform-specific APIs, or in other languages, as well as C++ programmers who have never written multi-threaded code before.    If you're a programmer accustomed to writing single-threaded applications, C++ Concurrency in Action will show you how to write your new parallel algorithm in C++. You'll learn to avoid many of the pitfalls associated with writing multi-threaded applications. You can also use this book to quickly transfer your platform-specific knowledge to the new Standard C++ threading library, enabling you to use a single API on both systems and simplify your code.",

A new species is evolving to take their place, one which is lean, fast, portable, and easy to maintain: Java servlets.    Servlets are not merely an alternative to CGI, for they can do much more. Servlets have opened the door to a world of client/server applications that would have been too difficult or too time-consuming to consider before.    Java Servlets: By Example takes the reader into the world of servlets, moving example by example from the simple to the complex. An early chapter explains the simple HTML form processing through servlets. A later chapter shows how to connect a Java applet to a servlet, which is itself connected to a database.    Java Servlets: By Example is full of real-world, ready-to-run example code. Each chapter deals with a new problem and takes the reader through a series of servlet-based solutions.

            "longDescription": "XSLT Quickly is, quite obviously, for anyone who needs to learn XSLT quickly. This book has two main goals: to familiarize the reader with the portions of XSLT that he/she will use eighty per cent of the time, and to provide a \"cookbook\" approach to learning additional techniques as they are needed.    Part One is a step-by-step tutorial that brings the reader up to speed on the basic concepts and document manipulation techniques necessary for the most common XSLT tasks. More importantly, it represents the foundation on which the understanding of everything in Part Two is built.    Part Two is a cookbook--a task-oriented user's guide to various issues one may meet in tackling XSLT. This portion of the book is organized by the goals of XSLT tasks (converting elements to attributes, reading in multiple documents at once, etc.). This makes it far easier for readers who don't already know XSLT to quickly find the solutions to their stylesheet development problems.    XSLT Quickly also includes a glossary, a quick reference section for XSLT syntax, and a quick reference for using the popular XSLT processors.",

            "longDescription": "When you look carefully, you notice patterns connecting the events that occur in any system. Some events have obvious and immediate relationships. Other patterns are more complex or develop over a longer time. Event Processing is the ability to identify and react to events and event patterns as they occur.    Event Processing in Action is a ground-breaking book that introduces the major concepts of event driven architectures and shows you how to use, design, and build event processing systems and applications. The book looks at practical examples and provides an in-depth explanation of their architecture and implementation. Throughout the book, you'll follow a comprehensive use case that expert authors Opher Etzion and Peter Niblett construct step-by-step.    Complex Event Processing, or CEP, is an emerging discipline, as well as an emerging market, which in 2008 is estimated in  150M and is expected to cross the  1B mark in 2-3 years. According to analysts' surveys, many businesses are starting to investigate both technical and business value considerations of implementing event processing into their organizations.    Event Processing in Action will answer key questions like:        * What are event driven architectures and how do they fit enterprise applications       * What are the various uses of event processing       * What are its major concepts       * What is the life-cycle of event driven application, and how should building such an application be approached     As the story unfolds through the construction of an event-driven application, readers will see how a specification in a graphical notation grows into a working example. Programming examples will be based on a set of building blocks developed in the book; existing commercial products and open source alternatives will be surveyed.    This book is intended for software architects and developers who want to understand the principles behind the emerging discipline of event processing, and go deeper to the details.",

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Microsoft's new user interface framework, gives you the ability to create stunning graphics, rich interactions, and highly-usable Windows applications. WPF is the API beneath Windows Vista interfaces, and it's also available for older versions of Windows. Up to this point, it has only been possible to build WPF applications manually, mainly by hand-coding in XAML   WPF's declarative XML-based markup language. The soon-to-be-released Visual Studio 2008 provides the full set of developer tools you need to take advantage of this exciting technology.    The combination of WPF and Visual Studio 2008 represents the start of the next generation of Windows applications. Hand-coding XAML is fine if you're an early adopter, but to put WPF into production, you need to master the tools and application styles you'll use in your day job.    WPF in Action with Visual Studio 2008 focuses on WPF development using Visual Studio 2008 and other available tools. The book starts with thorough coverage of the basics, layouts, styles, resources, and themes. It then takes you through several real-world scenarios, exploring common challenges and application-types. You'll build several sample applications, ranging from a simple calculator to a typical line-of-business application. Along the way, you'll add graphical elements, animation, and support for printing, accessibility, and other standard functionality.    Written in a witty, engaging style, WPF in Action with Visual Studio 2008 can be read cover-to-cover or used to reference specific problems and issues. The approach is practical and always focused on how you'll use WPF in real development scenarios. You'll learn how to handle the many new issues presented by the extreme flexibility of WPF.

Dynamic WAP Application Development first introduces the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and offers an in-depth explanation of the prominent wireless languages.    The authors begin with HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language), the first wireless language and one still supported by many Internet-enabled phones in the United States. They next cover WML (Wireless Markup Language), the XML-based successor to HDML that is supported by most phones worldwide. The third language described is WMLScript, the client-side scripting language of the wireless world that enables the developer to include procedure logic within their WML markup. In addition to hands-on practice with each of these languages, the book examines the issues involved in wireless application design and in converting HDML documents into WML.    The book also provides an overview of Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) and Java Servlets, and guides developers through the process of creating dynamic WAP applications using these server-side technologies.    Application design specific to the small display and limited memory capacity of wireless phones is also covered. Advanced topics include security, performance, and the intricacies of WAP gateways. The book also includes robust case studies that put WAP concepts into practice.

The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework.    IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming.    IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it's a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and    duck typing   , metaprogramming, and more.    IronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors provide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more.    Whether you're a Python user exploring .NET or a .NET developer exploring the world of dynamic languages, IronPython in Action will get you started quickly and show you how to be productive with this powerful new tool.",

            "longDescription": "You are a Java developer. You are asked to add a simple feature to your application. But \"simple\" can be deceiving: you have to make many changes, in locations which can be difficult to find.    If this sounds familiar, you want to know about Java reflection. With reflection, you can work smarter by designing flexible applications to which you can easily add likely new requirements. Then, with a few code changes in easy-to-find places, you've got the job done. Reflection adds a new dimension to your programming skills. It will boost your effectiveness.    Java Reflection in Action starts from the basics. It gradually builds a complete understanding, adding as it goes reflective concepts illustrated with many small examples that are useful in real applications.    In a subplot, the book follows a programmer, George, as he tackles common but difficult tasks. In each case, George finds flexible, reflective solutions that replace the usual hard-coded ones. The power of reflection becomes clear through his story.",

A rule engine automatically decides how to apply the rules to your facts and hands you the result. This approach is ideal for expressing business rules and is increasingly used in enterprise computing.    Jess is a popular rule engine written in Java. It's supported by Sandia Labs and has an active online community. If you have a problem that can be solved with rules, Jess in Action will show you how. (If you are not sure, read chapter 2.) Written by the creator of Jess, this book is an accessible and practical guide to rule-based system development in Java.

            "longDescription": "On any given day, a developer may encounter a system rife with languages, frameworks, and operating environments   none of which resemble the actual domain of the system he's being asked to develop! Success   and sanity   dictate that developers and designers work at higher levels of abstraction so that they can remain focused on the problems they're trying to solve. Domain Specific Languages, \"little languages\" implemented on top of a conventional programming language, provide a way to maintain the power of the underlying network of technology while writing code that more closely models the domain of the business problem.    DSLs in Action introduces the concepts and definitions a developer needs to build high-quality domain specific languages. It provides a solid foundation to the usage as well as implementation aspects of a DSL, focusing on the necessity of applications speaking the language of the domain. After reading this book, a programmer will be able to design APIs that make better domain models. For experienced developers, the book addresses the intricacies of domain language design without the pain of writing parsers by hand.    The gap in understanding between the development team and the business domain specialists can lead to errors during user acceptance tests. This book teaches developers to build DSLs that bridge this gap by offering API development techniques that closely model the domain vocabulary. Even non-programmer domain experts can benefit from this book by learning how DSLs can make them a more integral part of the team during the program development phase.    The book discusses DSL usage and implementations in the real world based on a suite of JVM languages like Java, Ruby, Scala, and Groovy. It contains code snippets that implement real world DSL designs and discusses the pros and cons of each implementation.    WHAT'S INSIDE        * Working with DSLs in real-life applications      * In-depth techniques of DSL implementation      * Meta-programming techniques      * Parser/Combinator based little languages      * Implementing DSLs on top of the JVM      * Real-world DSL examples      * Interoperability among JVM languages      * Correct level of abstraction for your domain APIs      * DSL and Domain Driven Design    This book is written especially for developers familiar with JVM-based languages, but many of the techniques presented will work in other programming environments as well.",
